<h2>Changes in release 5.1 (June 1995)</h2>

5.1 fills in the missing holes of 5.0, fixes a few bugs, and adds some
features.

<ul>
  <li> Fixed the bug (?) that caused no interpreters to show up under
       Tk 4.0b3.
  <li> Added this HTML help system (renderer based on code from Angel Li
       <tt>&lt;angel@flipper.rsmas.miami.edu&gt;</tt>.)
  <li> Added the command line interface.
  <li> Cleaned up the menus, added some keyboard bindings.
  <li> <b>tkinspect</b> nows reads <tt>~/.tkinspect_opts</tt> and
       <tt>.tkinspect_init</tt> (in the current directory.)
  <li> There's an external interface available.  See <a
       href=Miscellany>the miscellany help page</a>.

</ul>


<h2>Changes in release 5.0 (February 1995)</h2>

Release 5.0 was a complete rewrite of previous versions of
<b>tkinspect</b>.  This version runs only with Tk 4.0.
