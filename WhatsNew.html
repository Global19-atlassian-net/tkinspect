<h2>Changes in release 5.1.4 (21 June 1995)</h2>

5.1.4 adds more browsing lists, and has a few refinements.

<ul>
  <li> Added 3 new lists: <a href=Images.html>images</a>, <a
       href=Menus.html>menus</a>, and <a
       href=Canvases.html>canvases</a>.  The images
       list was contributed by Gero Kohnert
       <tt>&lt;gero@marvin.franken.de&gt;</tt>.
  <li> Added <tt>button-3</tt> bindings on lists and value (brings
       up menu.)
  <li> Added <b>Update This List</b> menu item to lists.
  <li> Cleaned up some things for Tk 4.0b4.
  <li> Renamed the <a href=Miscellany.html>interface function</a>
       <tt>tkinspect_value_text_window</tt> to
       <tt>tkinspect_value_text_widget</tt> (now returns the Tk text
       widget.)  Added <tt>tkinspect_display_image</tt>,
       <tt>tkinspect_show_list</tt>, and <tt>tkinspect_remove_list</tt>.
</ul>

<h2>Changes in release 5.1 (5 June 1995)</h2>

5.1 fills in the missing holes of 5.0, fixes a few bugs, and adds some
features.

<ul>
  <li> Fixed the bug (?) that caused no interpreters to show up under
       Tk 4.0b3.
  <li> Added this HTML help system (renderer based on code from Angel Li
       <tt>&lt;angel@flipper.rsmas.miami.edu&gt;</tt>.)
  <li> Added the command line interface.
  <li> Cleaned up the menus, added some keyboard bindings.
  <li> <b>tkinspect</b> nows reads <tt>~/.tkinspect_opts</tt> and
       <tt>.tkinspect_init</tt> (in the current directory.)
  <li> There's an external interface available.  See <a
       href=Miscellany>the miscellany help page</a>.

</ul>


<h2>Changes in release 5.0 (February 1995)</h2>

Release 5.0 was a complete rewrite of previous versions of
<b>tkinspect</b>.  This version runs only with Tk 4.0.
