<center><h1>Lists</h1></center>

The lists are the listboxes just below the <b>Command:</b> entry.
By default, there are three lists:

<ul>
  <li> <a href=Procs.html>Procs</a> contains a list of all the Tcl
       procedures in the target application.
  <li> <a href=Globals.html>Globals</a> contains a list of the global
       variables of the target application.
  <li> <a href=Windows.html>Windows</a> contains a list of the windows
       of the target application.
</ul>

Each list also has a menu in the menu bar.  The menu contains a set of
standard operations, followed by list-specific operations (if any are
available.)  The standard list operations are:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Show a X..</b> brings up a dialog that prompts for the name
       of a proc, global, or window and places the its value in the <a
       href=Value.html>value window</a>.
  <li> <b>Find X...</b> brings up a dialog that searches the list.
  <li> <b>Edit Filter...</b> brings up a dialog that allows editing of
       the list filter.  The list will only displays those items that
       either match or don't match a set of patterns.  (The default
       list of patterns varies for each list type.)
  <li> <b>Remove List</b> removes the list from the <b>tkinspect</b>
       window.  The list can be added back again via the
       <b>Options</b> menu.
</ul>
