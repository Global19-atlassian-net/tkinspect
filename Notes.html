<center><h1>Tkinspect Notes</h1></center>

<b>tkinspect</b> started as a quick hack to help me debug my Tk
programs.  Since then, I've also used <b>tkinspect</b> to explore and
experiment with Tk programming.  What started out as a 150 line one
day hack has grown to nearly 3000 lines of Tcl.  I'm having a lot of
fun programming in Tcl, and so I expect <b>tkinspect</b> will continue
to grow and evolve.<p>

<b>tkinspect</b> was written using a object system written in Tcl.
The object system is really just a way to group a Tcl array and a
bunch of procedures.  It's part of a larger Tcl library of mine called
<b>STL</b>.  <b>tkinspect</b> includes a subset of that library.<p>
