			tkinspect, release 5.1.4
			    (June 21, 1995)

This is the 5th release of my browser for Tk programs.  This version
of tkinspect requires Tk 4.0 or better (tested only with Tk 4.0b4,
and things will probably fail on previous betas).

To install: type "wish -f install.tcl", fill out the form, and hit the
install button.

Hopefully you can learn how to use tkinspect by selecting an
interpreter (via the File, Select Interpreter menu item) and then
clicking on things.  This version also includes a online help system.

tkinspect itself is still public domain, you may do whatever you want
with it.  However, tkinspect uses a hacked down library that I've
written at LBL, so the files in stl-lite are copyright 1995 Lawrence
Berkeley Lab.  See stl-lite/COPYRIGHT for the full copyright notice.

Please send me any comments or suggestions you might have, along with
any bugs that you may encounter.
