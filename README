			tkinspect, release 5.0.2
			    (Feb 10, 1995)

This is the 5th release of my browser for Tk programs.  This version
of tkinspect requires Tk 4.0b2 or better.

To install: type "wish -f install.tcl", fill out the form, and hit the
install button.

Hopefully you can learn how to use tkinspect by selecting an
interpreter (via the File, Select Interpreter menu item) and then
clicking on things.  Unlike tkinspect-4 there is no online help (but
writing some is on my todo list.)

tkinspect itself is still public domain, you may do whatever you want
with it.  However, tkinspect uses a hacked down library that I've
written at LBL, so the files in stl-lite are copyright 1994 Lawrence
Berkeley Lab.  See stl-lite/COPYRIGHT for the full copyright notice.

Please send me any comments or suggestions you might have, along with
any bugs that you may encounter.
